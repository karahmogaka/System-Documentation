Clearing DHIS2 Cache
=====================

Clearing the cache in DHIS2 can be important for several reasons, similar to clearing the cache in other software applications. DHIS2 cache stores temporary data to enhance performance and reduce the load on the server. 

Clearing the cache can be necessary for the following reasons:

#. Data Accuracy: Cached data in DHIS2 can become outdated, potentially leading to inaccurate reporting and decision-making. Clearing the cache ensures that users are working with the latest data.
#. Performance: Over time, a large cache can slow down the performance of DHIS2, especially if the cache contains a significant amount of data. Clearing the cache can help improve system responsiveness.


To clear the DHIS2 cache, follow these steps

#. Access the DHIS applications menu.
#. Choose the "Browser Cache Cleaner" option.
#. Inside the DHIS 2 Browser Cache Cleaner, click "Select All," and then proceed to click "Clear all selected items."
#. After selecting the cache type, you may be asked to confirm the cache clearing action. Confirm the action, and DHIS2 will proceed to clear the selected cache.
#. Once it's complete, you should see a confirmation message. (The time it takes to clear the cache depends on the size of the cache and your server's performance)
#. After clearing the cache, it's good practice to test the system to ensure that it's functioning correctly, and that the data is up to date.
