Maintainance
=====================

Maintaining a DHIS2 instance involves several key components, each with its own set of tasks and actions. Here's a summary of the main maintenance components in DHIS2:

  * Categories
Categories are used for grouping and classifying data elements, indicators, and other data objects. They help organize and categorize data for reporting and analysis.
Components: Categories include category options, category option combos, and data elements or indicators assignment.

Actions: Within categories, administrators can create, manage, and customize categories and their associated options. They can also assign data elements or indicators to these categories to streamline data management.

  * Organizational Units (OrgUnits)
Organizational units represent entities within an organization's hierarchy, such as health facilities or regions. They are fundamental for data collection and reporting.
Components: OrgUnits include the org unit hierarchy, org unit groups, and data assignment to org units.

Actions: Admins can create, edit, and maintain org units, define their hierarchical structure, and group them for easier management. Data elements or indicators can be assigned to org units for specific data collection.

  * Datasets
Datasets are collections of data elements used to define the specific data to be collected or reported on.
Components: Datasets consist of data elements, indicators, forms, and other data-related objects.

Actions: Maintenance tasks include creating datasets, adding, or removing data elements or indicators, defining data entry forms, and specifying validation rules for data collection.

  * Data Elements
Data elements represent the individual data points collected in DHIS2, such as patient counts or health indicators.
Components: Data elements options include data element group, data element group set and  can have category combinations, attributes, and indicators associated with them.

Actions: Admins can create, edit, and manage data elements, associate them with categories, assign attributes, and link them to indicators for reporting.

  * Indicators
Indicators are calculations or derived values that provide insights into data. They are often used for reporting and analysis.
Components: Indicators consist indicator types, indicator group, indicator group set, program indicator and program indicator group.

Actions: Admins can create indicators by defining expressions, setting targets, and specifying how data should be disaggregated for more detailed analysis.

  * Programs
Programs in DHIS2 are designed to manage and track specific healthcare programs or interventions, such as immunization programs, disease management, or maternal health services.
Components: Programs include program stages, program data elements, tracked entity type, and program rules.

Actions: Maintenance tasks involve creating and configuring programs, defining program stages, selecting program data elements, creating indicators to measure program performance, and setting up program rules for data validation and decision support.
