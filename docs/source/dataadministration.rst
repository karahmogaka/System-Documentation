Data Administration
=====================
Data administration in DHIS2 is a crucial aspect of managing and maintaining the system's data. Key activities associated with data administration include:

#. Data Integrity
Data integrity in DHIS2 ensures that data is accurate, consistent, and reliable. It involves preventing data entry errors, enforcing validation rules, and maintaining the quality of data throughout its lifecycle. Administrators configure validation rules, constraints, and data quality checks to ensure that data entered on DHIS2 meets predefined criteria. Data integrity measures help minimize errors and maintain data quality.

#. Maintenance
Maintenance tasks in DHIS2 ensure the smooth and efficient operation of the system. This includes routine upkeep, database optimization, and applying software updates. Administrators perform regular system backups, monitor system performance, schedule database maintenance tasks, and apply software updates to keep DHIS2 secure and up to date.

#. Resource Tables
Resource tables in DHIS2 store metadata and resource information that is essential for data management and analytics. They are automatically managed by DHIS2 to store various types of metadata, including data element definitions, category options, organizational unit hierarchies. 

#. Analytics Tables
Analytics tables are specialized database tables in DHIS2 that store aggregated and calculated data for reporting and analysis purposes. DHIS2 automatically generates and populates analytics tables through scheduled data aggregation processes. 

#.Data Exception
Data exceptions help identify and handle data anomalies or irregularities that may occur in the system.
Data exception rules can be configured and alerts to detect and notify users of data anomalies, missing values, or unexpected data patterns will be generated. These rules assist in maintaining data quality and identifying issues for resolution.

#. Min-Max Value Generation
Min-max value generation calculates and sets minimum and maximum values for data elements to ensure data consistency and accuracy. Administrators configure rules and criteria to calculate and assign minimum and maximum values to data elements automatically. This helps maintain data quality and consistency.

#. Data Statistics
Data statistics in DHIS2 provide insights into data trends, distribution, and summary statistics.DHIS2 generates data statistics, such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and others, for numerical data elements. Users can access these statistics to analyze data patterns and make informed decisions.
